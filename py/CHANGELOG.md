## 0.3.0

- Changed PII stripping rule format to permit path selectors when applying rules. This means that now `$string` refers to strings for instance and `user.id` refers to the `id` field in the `user` attribute of the event. Temporarily support for old rules is retained.

## 0.2.7

- Minor fixes to be closer to Python. Ability to disable trimming of objects, arrays and strings.

## 0.2.6

- Fix bug where PII stripping would remove containers without leaving any metadata about the retraction.
- Fix bug where old `redactPair` rules would stop working.

## 0.2.5

- Rewrite of PII stripping logic. This brings potentially breaking changes to the semantics of PII configs. Most importantly field types such as `"freeform"` and `"databag"` are gone, right now there is only `"container"` and `"text"`. All old field types should have become an alias for `"text"`, but take extra care in ensuring your PII rules still work.

- Minor fixes to be closer to Python.

## 0.2.4

- Remove stray print statement.

## 0.2.3

- Fix main performance issues.

## 0.2.2

- Fix segfault when trying to process contexts.

- Don't serialize empty arrays and objects (with a few exceptions).
