# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Always create a spans array for transactions in normalization. ([#667](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/667))
- Retain the full span description in transaction events instead of trimming it. ([#674](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/674))

## 0.5.11

- Add SpanStatus to span struct. ([#603](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/603))
- Apply clock drift correction for timestamps that are too far in the past or future. This fixes a bug where broken transaction timestamps would lead to negative durations. ([#634](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/634), [#654](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/654))
- Add missing .NET 4.8 version mapping for runtime context normalization. ([#642](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/642))
- Expose `DataCategory` and `SpanStatus` via the C-ABI to Python for code sharing. ([#651](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/651))

## 0.5.10

- Set default transaction name ([#576](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/576))
- Apply clock drift correction based on received_at ([#580](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/580), [#582](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/582))
- Add AWS Security Scanner to web crawlers ([#577](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/577))
- Do not default transactions to level error ([#585](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/585))
- Update `sentry-release-parser` to 0.6.0 ([#590](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/590))

- Minor updates to PII processing: Aliases for value types (`$error` instead of `$exception` to be in sync with Discover column naming) and adding a default for replace-redactions.
- It is now valid to send transactions and spans without `op` set, in which case a default value will be inserted.

## 0.5.5

## 0.3.0

- Changed PII stripping rule format to permit path selectors when applying rules. This means that now `$string` refers to strings for instance and `user.id` refers to the `id` field in the `user` attribute of the event. Temporarily support for old rules is retained.

## 0.2.7

- Minor fixes to be closer to Python. Ability to disable trimming of objects, arrays and strings.

- Rewrite of PII stripping logic. This brings potentially breaking changes to the semantics of PII configs. Most importantly field types such as `"freeform"` and `"databag"` are gone, right now there is only `"container"` and `"text"`. All old field types should have become an alias for `"text"`, but take extra care in ensuring your PII rules still work.

- Fix main performance issues.
