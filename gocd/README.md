# Relay Pipelines

The relay pipelines are rendered as a
[pipedream](https://www.notion.so/sentry/Pipedreams-in-GoCD-with-Jsonnet-430f46b87fa14650a80adf6708b088d9).

## Dependencies

You'll need the following dependencies to build the pipelines:

```sh
brew install go-jsonnet jsonnet-bundler yq
```

## Jsonnet

You can render the jsonnet pipelines by running:

```sh
make gocd
```

This will clean, fmt, lint and generate the GoCD pipelines to
`./gocd/generated-pipelines`.

The Relay pipelines are using the https://github.com/getsentry/gocd-jsonnet
libraries to generate the pipeline for each region.

## Files

Below is a description of the directories in the `gocd/` directory.

### `gocd/templates/`

These are a set of jsonnet and libsonnet files which are used
to generate the relay pipelines. This avoids duplication across
our GoCD pipeline files as we deploy to multiple regions.

The `gocd/templates/relay.jsonnet` file is the entry point for the
relay pipelines.

`gocd/templates/libs/*.libsonnet` define the pipeline behaviors for
deploy relay and relay-pops. These libraries are used to create a
GoCD pipeline, following the same naming as the
[GoCD yaml pipelines](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-yaml-config-plugin#readme).

`gocd/templates/bash/*.sh` are shell scripts that are inlined in the
result pipelines. This seperation means syntax highlighting and
extra tooling works for relay's bash scripts.

`gocd/templates/jsonnetfile.json` and `gocd/templates/jsonnetfile.lock.json`
are used by [jsonnet-bundler](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler#readme), a package manager for jsonnet.

You can update jsonnet dependencies by runnning `jb update`.

### `gocd/generated-pipelines/`

The jsonnet files are read directly, so the generated pipelines are not
commited to the repo.
