/// A message interface for [services](Service).
///
/// Most commonly, this interface is an enumeration of messages, but it can also be implemented on a
/// single message. For each individual message, this type needs to implement the [`FromMessage`]
/// trait.
///
/// # Implementating Interfaces
///
/// There are three main ways to implement interfaces, which depends on the number of messages and
/// their return values. The simplest way is an interface consisting of a **single message** with
/// **no return value**. For this case, use the message directly as interface and choose
/// `NoResponse` as response:
///
/// ```
/// use relay_system::{FromMessage, Interface, NoResponse};
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub struct MyMessage;
///
/// impl Interface for MyMessage {}
///
/// impl FromMessage<Self> for MyMessage {
///     type Response = NoResponse;
///
///     fn from_message(message: Self, _: ()) -> Self {
///         message
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If there is a **single message with a return value**, implement the interface as a wrapper for
/// the message and the return [`Sender`]:
///
/// ```
/// use relay_system::{AsyncResponse, FromMessage, Interface, Sender};
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub struct MyMessage;
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub struct MyInterface(MyMessage, Sender<bool>);
///
/// impl Interface for MyInterface {}
///
/// impl FromMessage<MyMessage> for MyInterface {
///     type Response = AsyncResponse<bool>;
///
///     fn from_message(message: MyMessage, sender: Sender<bool>) -> Self {
///         Self(message, sender)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Finally, interfaces with **multiple messages** of any kind can most commonly be implemented
/// through an enumeration for every message. The variants of messages with return values need a
/// `Sender` again:
///
/// ```
/// use relay_system::{AsyncResponse, FromMessage, Interface, NoResponse, Sender};
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub struct GetFlag;
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub struct SetFlag(pub bool);
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub enum MyInterface {
///     Get(GetFlag, Sender<bool>),
///     Set(SetFlag),
/// }
///
/// impl Interface for MyInterface {}
///
/// impl FromMessage<GetFlag> for MyInterface {
///     type Response = AsyncResponse<bool>;
///
///     fn from_message(message: GetFlag, sender: Sender<bool>) -> Self {
///         Self::Get(message, sender)
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl FromMessage<SetFlag> for MyInterface {
///     type Response = NoResponse;
///

///         Self::Set(message)
