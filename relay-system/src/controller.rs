/// Service to start and gracefully stop the system runtime.

/// This service offers a static API to wait for a shutdown signal or manually initiate the Relay
/// shutdown. To use this functionality, it first needs to be started with [`Controller::start`].
///
/// To shut down gracefully, other services can register with [`Controller::shutdown_handle`]. When
/// a shutdown signal is sent to the process, every service will receive a [`Shutdown`] message with
/// an optional timeout. To wait for the entire shutdown sequence including the shutdown timeout
/// instead, use [`finished`](ShutdownHandle::finished). It resolves when the shutdown has
/// completed.
///
/// ## Signals
///
/// By default, the controller watches for process signals and converts them into graceful or
/// immediate shutdown messages. These signals are platform-dependent:
///
///  - Unix: `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` trigger an immediate shutdown, `SIGTERM` a graceful one.
///  - Windows: `CTRL-C`, `CTRL-BREAK`, `CTRL-CLOSE` all trigger an immediate shutdown.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// use relay_system::{Controller, Service, Shutdown, ShutdownMode};
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// struct MyService;
///
/// impl Service for MyService {
///     type Interface = ();
///

///         tokio::spawn(async move {
///             let mut shutdown = Controller::shutdown_handle();
///
///             loop {
///                 tokio::select! {
///                     shutdown = shutdown.notified() => break, // Handle shutdown here
///                     Some(message) = rx.recv() => (),         // Process incoming message
///                 }
