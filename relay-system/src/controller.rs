/// Actor to start and gracefully stop an actix system.
///
/// This actor contains a static `run` method which will run an actix system and block the current
/// thread until the system shuts down again.
///
/// This actor starts with default configuration. To change this configuration, send the
/// [`Configure`] message.
///
/// To shut down more gracefully, other actors can register with the [`Subscribe`] message. When a
/// shutdown signal is sent to the process, they will receive a [`Shutdown`] message with an
/// optional timeout. They can respond with a future, after which they will be stopped. Once all
/// registered actors have stopped successfully, the entire system will stop.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// use actix::prelude::*;
/// use relay_system::{Controller, Shutdown};
///
/// struct MyActor;
///
/// impl Actor for MyActor {
///     type Context = Context<Self>;
