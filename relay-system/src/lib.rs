//! Foundational system components for Relay's services.
//!
//! Relay's system is based on [`tokio`]. To use any of these components, ensure a tokio runtime is
//! available.
//!
//! # Services
//!
//! The basic building block in Relay are asynchronous [`Service`]s. Each service implements an
//! [`Interface`], which consists of one or many messages that can be sent to the service using its
//! [`Addr`]. See the docs of these types for more information on how to implement and use them.
//!
//! # Shutdown
//!
//! The static [`Controller`] service can listen for process signals and initiate a graceful
//! shutdown. Note that services must check a [`ShutdownHandle`] to receive these signals. See the
//! struct level documentation for more information.
