//!
//! Relay is a standalone service for scrubbing personal information and improving event submission
//! response time. It acts as a middle layer between your application and Sentry.io. For information
//! on setting up Relay in front of Sentry, see:
//!
//! [Relay documentation]
//!
//! # Event Ingestion
//!
//! Relay is also the primary event ingestion system at Sentry. When compiled with the `processing`
//! feature and configured for ingestion, Relay ships functionality for:
//!
//!  - Acknowledging and handling web requests on store endpoints
//!  - Applying rate limits and inbound data filters
//!  - Data scrubbing of event payloads and attachments
//!  - Validation and normalization of malformed or outdated data
//!  - Forwarding of all information into the event processing pipeline
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! - `processing`: Includes event ingestion and processing functionality. This should only be
//!   specified when compiling Relay as Sentry service. Standalone Relays do not need this feature.
//! - `crash-handler`: Allows native crash reporting for segfaults and out-of-memory situations when
//!   internal error reporting to Sentry is enabled.
//!
//! # Workspace Crates
//!
//! Relay is split into the following workspace crates:
//!
//!  - `relay`: Main entry point and command line interface.
//!  - [`relay-auth`]: Authentication and crypto.
//!  - [`relay-base-schema`]: Basic types for Relay's API schema used across multiple services.
//!  - [`relay-cabi`]: C-bindings for exposing functionality to Python.
//!  - [`relay-cardinality`]: Metrics cardinality limiter.
//!  - [`relay-common`]: Common utilities and crate re-exports.
//!  - [`relay-config`]: Static configuration for the CLI and server.
//!  - [`relay-cogs`]: Break down the cost of Relay by its features.
//!  - [`relay-crash`]: Crash reporting for the Relay server.
//!  - [`relay-dynamic-config`]: Dynamic configuration passed from Sentry.
//!  - [`relay-event-derive`]: Derive for visitor traits on the Event schema.
//!  - [`relay-event-normalization`]: Event normalization and processing.
//!  - [`relay-event-schema`]: Event schema (Error, Transaction, Security) and types for event processing.
//!  - [`relay-ffi`]: Utilities for error handling in FFI bindings.
//!  - [`relay-ffi-macros`]: Macros for error handling in FFI bindings.
//!  - [`relay-filter`]: Inbound data filters.
//!  - [`relay-jsonschema-derive`]: Derive for JSON schema on Relay protocol types.
//!  - [`relay-kafka`]: Kafka-related functionality.
//!  - [`relay-log`]: Error reporting and logging.
//!  - [`relay-metrics`]: Metrics protocol and processing.
//!  - [`relay-monitors`]: Monitors protocol and processing for Sentry.
//!  - [`relay-pii`]: Scrubbing of personally identifiable information (PII) from events
//!  - [`relay-profiling`]: Profiling protocol and processing.
//!  - [`relay-protocol`]: Types and traits for building JSON-based protocols and schemas.
//!  - [`relay-protocol-derive`]: Derives for Relay's protocol traits.
//!  - [`relay-quotas`]: Sentry quotas and rate limiting.
//!  - [`relay-redis`]: Pooled Redis and Redis cluster abstraction.
//!  - [`relay-replays`]: Session replay protocol and processing.
//!  - [`relay-sampling`]: Dynamic sampling functionality.
//!  - [`relay-server`]: Endpoints and services.
//!  - [`relay-statsd`]: High-level StatsD metric client for internal measurements.
//!  - [`relay-system`]: Foundational system components for Relay's services.
//!  - [`relay-test`]: Helpers for testing the web server and services.
//!  - [`relay-ua`]: User agent parser with built-in rules.
//!
//! # Tools
//!
//! Complementary to the Relay binary, the workspace contains a set of tools to interface with some
//! of Relay's functionality or to export information:
//!
//!  - [`document-metrics`]: Generate documentation for metrics.
//!  - [`generate-schema`]: Generate an event payload schema file.
//!  - [`process-event`]: Process a Sentry event payload.
//!  - [`scrub-minidump`]: Scrub PII from a Minidump file.
