/// Tracks the lifetime of an [`Envelope`] in Relay.
///
/// The envelope context accompanies envelopes through the processing pipeline in Relay and ensures
/// that outcomes are recorded when the Envelope is dropped. They can be dropped in one of three
/// ways:
///
///  - By calling [`accept`](Self::accept). Responsibility of the envelope has been transferred to
///    another service, and no further outcomes need to be recorded.
///  - By calling [`reject`](Self::reject). The entire envelope was dropped, and the outcome
///    specifies the reason.
///  - By dropping the envelope context. This indicates an issue or a bug and raises the
///    `"internal"` outcome. There should be additional error handling to report an error to Sentry.
///
/// The envelope context also holds a processing queue permit which is used for backpressure
/// management. It is automatically reclaimed when the context is dropped along with the envelope.
