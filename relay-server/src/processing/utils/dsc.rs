/// Ensures there is a valid dynamic sampling context and corresponding project state.
///
/// The dynamic sampling context (DSC) specifies the project_key of the project that initiated
/// the trace. That project state should have been loaded previously by the project cache and is
/// available on the `ProcessEnvelopeState`. Under these conditions, this cannot happen:
///
///  - There is no DSC in the envelope headers. This occurs with older or third-party SDKs.
///  - The project key does not exist. This can happen if the project key was disabled, the
///    project removed, or in rare cases when a project from another Sentry instance is referred
///    to.
///  - The project key refers to a project from another organization. In this case the project
///    cache does not resolve the state and instead leaves it blank.
///  - The project state could not be fetched. This is a runtime error, but in this case Relay
///    should fall back to the next-best sampling rule set.
///
/// In all of the above cases, this function will compute a new DSC using information from the
/// event payload, similar to how SDKs do this. The `sampling_project_state` is also switched to
/// the main project state.
///
/// If there is no transaction event in the envelope, this function will do nothing.
///
/// The function will return the sampling project information of the root project for the event. If
/// no sampling project information is specified, the project information of the eventâ€™s project
/// will be returned.
