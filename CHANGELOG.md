## 23.4.0

**Breaking Changes**:

This release contains major changes to the web layer, including TCP and HTTP handling as well as all web endpoint handlers. Due to these changes, some functionality was retired and Relay responds differently in specific cases.

Configuration:

- SSL support has been dropped. As per [official guidelines](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/operating-guidelines/), Relay should be operated behind a reverse proxy, which can perform SSL termination.
- Connection config options `max_connections`, `max_pending_connections`, and `max_connection_rate` no longer have an effect. Instead, configure the reverse proxy to handle connection concurrency as needed.

Endpoints:

- The security endpoint no longer forwards to upstream if the mime type doesn't match supported mime types. Instead, the request is rejected with a corresponding error.
- Passing store payloads as `?sentry_data=<base64>` query parameter is restricted to `GET` requests on the store endpoint. Other endpoints require the payload to be passed in the request body.
- Requests with an invalid `content-encoding` header will now be rejected. Exceptions to this are an empty string and `UTF-8`, which have been sent historically by some SDKs and are now treated as identity (no encoding). Previously, all unknown encodings were treated as identity.
- Temporarily, response bodies for some errors are rendered as plain text instead of JSON. This will be addressed in an upcoming release.

Metrics:

- The `route` tag of request metrics uses the route pattern instead of schematic names. There is an exact replacement for every previous route. For example, `"store-default"` is now tagged as `"/api/:project_id/store/"`.
- Statsd metrics `event.size_bytes.raw` and `event.size_bytes.uncompressed` have been removed.

**Features**:

- Allow monitor checkins to paass `monitor_config` for monitor upserts. ([#1962](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/1962))

- Add product-name for devices, derived from the android model. ([#2004](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/2004))
- Changes how device class is determined for iPhone devices. Instead of checking processor frequency, the device model is mapped to a device class. ([#1970](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/1970))
- Don't sanitize transactions if no clustering rules exist and no UUIDs were scrubbed. ([#1976](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/1976))
- Add `thread.lock_mechanism` field to protocol. ([#1979](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/1979))

## 20.12.0

**Features**:

- Add `kafka-ssl` compilation feature that builds Kafka linked against OpenSSL. This feature is enabled in Docker containers only. This is only relevant for Relays running as part of on-premise Sentry. ([#881](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/881))
- Relay is now able to ingest pre-aggregated sessions, which will make it possible to efficiently handle applications that produce thousands of sessions per second. ([#815](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/815))

- Fix a panic in CSP filters. ([#848](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/848))
- Do not drop sessions due to an invalid age constraint set to `0`. ([#855](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/855))
- Do not emit outcomes after forwarding envelopes to the upstream, even if that envelope is rate limited, rejected, or dropped. Since the upstream logs an outcome, it would be a duplicate. ([#857](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/857))
- Fix status code for security report. ([#864](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/864))
- Add missing fields for Expect-CT reports. ([#865](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/865))

**Internal**:

- Add _experimental_ support for picking up HTTP proxies from the regular environment variables. This feature needs to be enabled by setting `http: client: "reqwest"` in your `config.yml`. ([#839](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/839))
- Refactor transparent request forwarding for unknown endpoints. Requests are now entirely buffered in memory and occupy the same queues and actors as other requests. This should not cause issues but may change behavior under load. ([#839](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/839))
- Add reason codes to the `X-Sentry-Rate-Limits` header in store responses. This allows external Relays to emit outcomes with the proper reason codes. ([#850](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/850))
- Emit metrics for outcomes in external relays. ([#851](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/851))
- Make `$error.value` `pii=true`. ([#837](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/837))
- Send `key_id` in partial project config. ([#854](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/854))
- Add stack traces to Sentry error reports. ([#872](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/872))

## 20.11.1

- No documented changes.

## 20.11.0

**Features**:

- Rename upstream retries histogram metric and add upstream requests duration metric. ([#816](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/816))
- Add options for metrics buffering (`metrics.buffering`) and sampling (`metrics.sample_rate`). ([#821](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/821))

**Bug Fixes**:

- Accept sessions with IP address set to `{{auto}}`. This was previously rejected and silently dropped. ([#827](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/827))
- Fix an issue where every retry-after response would be too large by one minute. ([#829](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/829))

**Internal**:

- Always apply cache debouncing for project states. This reduces pressure on the Redis and file system cache. ([#819](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/819))
- Internal refactoring such that validating of characters in tags no longer uses regexes internally. ([#814](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/814))
- Discard invalid user feedback sent as part of envelope. ([#823](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/823))
- Emit event errors and normalization errors for unknown breadcrumb keys. ([#824](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/824))
- Normalize `breadcrumb.ty` into `breadcrumb.type` for broken Python SDK versions. ([#824](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/824))
- Add the client SDK interface for unreal crashes and set the name to `unreal.crashreporter`. ([#828](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/828))
- Fine-tune the selectors for minidump PII scrubbing. ([#818](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/818), [#830](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/830))

## 20.10.1

**Internal**:

- Emit more useful normalization meta data for invalid tags. ([#808](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/808))

## 20.10.0

**Features**:

- Add support for measurement ingestion. ([#724](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/724), [#785](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/785))
- Add support for scrubbing UTF-16 data in attachments ([#742](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/742), [#784](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/784), [#787](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/787))
- Add upstream request metric. ([#793](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/793))
- The padding character in attachment scrubbing has been changed to match the masking character, there is no usability benefit from them being different. ([#810](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/810))

**Bug Fixes**:

- Fix issue where `$span` would not be recognized in Advanced Data Scrubbing. ([#781](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/781))
- Accept big-endian minidumps. ([#789](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/789))
- Detect network outages and retry sending events instead of dropping them. ([#788](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/788))

**Internal**:

- Project states are now cached separately per DSN public key instead of per project ID. This means that there will be multiple separate cache entries for projects with more than one DSN. ([#778](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/778))
- Relay no longer uses the Sentry endpoint to resolve project IDs by public key. Ingestion for the legacy store endpoint has been refactored to rely on key-based caches only. As a result, the legacy endpoint is supported only on managed Relays. ([#800](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/800))
- Fix rate limit outcomes, now emitted only for error events but not transactions. ([#806](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/806), [#809](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/809))

## 20.9.0

**Features**:

- Add support for attaching Sentry event payloads in Unreal crash reports by adding `__sentry` game data entries. ([#715](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/715))
- Support chunked form data keys for event payloads on the Minidump endpoint. Since crashpad has a limit for the length of custom attributes, the sentry event payload can be split up into `sentry__1`, `sentry__2`, etc. ([#721](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/721))
- Periodically re-authenticate with the upstream server. Previously, there was only one initial authentication. ([#731](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/731))
- The module attribute on stack frames (`$frame.module`) and the (usually server side generated) attribute `culprit` can now be scrubbed with advanced data scrubbing. ([#744](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/744))
- Compress outgoing store requests for events and envelopes including attachements using `gzip` content encoding. ([#745](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/745))
- Relay now buffers all requests until it has authenticated with the upstream. ([#747](//github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/747))
- Add a configuration option to change content encoding of upstream store requests. The default is `gzip`, and other options are `identity`, `deflate`, or `br`. ([#771](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/771))

**Bug Fixes**:

- Send requests to the `/envelope/` endpoint instead of the older `/store/` endpoint. This particularly fixes spurious `413 Payload Too Large` errors returned when using Relay with Sentry SaaS. ([#746](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/746))

**Internal**:

- Remove a temporary flag from attachment kafka messages indicating rate limited crash reports to Sentry. This is now enabled by default. ([#718](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/718))
- Performance improvement of http requests to upstream, high priority messages are sent first. ([#678](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/678))
- Experimental data scrubbing on minidumps([#682](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/682))
- Move `generate-schema` from the Relay CLI into a standalone tool. ([#739](//github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/739))
- Move `process-event` from the Relay CLI into a standalone tool. ([#740](//github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/740))
- Add the client SDK to session kafka payloads. ([#751](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/751))
- Add a standalone tool to document metrics in JSON or YAML. ([#752](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/752))
- Emit `processing.event.produced` for user report and session Kafka messages. ([#757](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/757))
- Improve performance of event processing by avoiding regex clone. ([#767](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/767))
- Assign a default name for unnamed attachments, which prevented attachments from being stored in Sentry. ([#769](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/769))
- Add Relay version version to challenge response. ([#758](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/758))

## 20.8.0

**Features**:

- Add the `http.connection_timeout` configuration option to adjust the connection and SSL handshake timeout. The default connect timeout is now increased from 1s to 3s. ([#688](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/688))
- Supply Relay's version during authentication and check if this Relay is still supported. An error message prompting to upgrade Relay will be supplied if Relay is unsupported. ([#697](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/697))

**Bug Fixes**:

- Reuse connections for upstream event submission requests when the server supports connection keepalive. Relay did not consume the response body of all requests, which caused it to reopen a new connection for every event. ([#680](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/680), [#695](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/695))
- Fix hashing of user IP addresses in data scrubbing. Previously, this could create invalid IP addresses which were later rejected by Sentry. Now, the hashed IP address is moved to the `id` field. ([#692](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/692))
- Do not retry authentication with the upstream when a client error is reported (status code 4XX). ([#696](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/696))

**Internal**:

- Extract the event `timestamp` from Minidump files during event normalization. ([#662](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/662))
- Retain the full span description in transaction events instead of trimming it. ([#674](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/674))
- Report all Kafka producer errors to Sentry. Previously, only immediate errors were reported but not those during asynchronous flushing of messages. ([#677](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/677))
- Add "HubSpot Crawler" to the list of web crawlers for inbound filters. ([#693](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/693))
- Improved typing for span data of transaction events, no breaking changes. ([#713](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/713))
- **Breaking change:** In PII configs, all options on hash and mask redactions (replacement characters, ignored characters, hash algorithm/key) are removed. If they still exist in the configuration, they are ignored. ([#760](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/760))

## 20.7.2

**Features**:

- Report metrics for connections to the upstream. These metrics are reported under `connector.*` and include information on connection reuse, timeouts and errors. ([#669](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/669))
- Increased the maximum size of attachments from _50MiB_ to _100MiB_. Most notably, this allows to upload larger minidumps. ([#671](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/671))

**Internal**:

- Always create a spans array for transactions in normalization. This allows Sentry to render the spans UI even if the transaction is empty. ([#667](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/667))

## 20.7.1

- No documented changes.

## 20.7.0

**Features**:

- Sessions and attachments can be rate limited now. These rate limits apply separately from error events, which means that you can continue to send Release Health sessions while you're out of quota with errors. ([#636](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/636))

**Bug Fixes**:

- Outcomes from downstream relays were not forwarded upstream. ([#632](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/632))
- Apply clock drift correction to Release Health sessions and validate timestamps. ([#633](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/633))
- Apply clock drift correction for timestamps that are too far in the past or future. This fixes a bug where broken transaction timestamps would lead to negative durations. ([#634](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/634), [#654](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/654))
- Respond with status code `200 OK` to rate limited minidump and UE4 requests. Third party clients otherwise retry those requests, leading to even more load. ([#646](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/646), [#647](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/647))
- Ingested unreal crash reports no longer have a `misc_primary_cpu_brand` key with GPU information set in the Unreal context. ([#650](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/650))
- Fix ingestion of forwarded outcomes in processing Relays. Previously, `emit_outcomes` had to be set explicitly to enable this. ([#653](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/653))

**Internal**:

- Restructure the envelope and event ingestion paths into a pipeline and apply rate limits to all envelopes. ([#635](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/635), [#636](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/636))
- Pass the combined size of all attachments in an envelope to the Redis rate limiter as quantity to enforce attachment quotas. ([#639](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/639))
- Emit flags for rate limited processing attachments and add a `size` field. ([#640](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/640), [#644](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/644))

## 20.6.0

We have switched to [CalVer](https://calver.org/)! Relay's version is always in line with the latest version of [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry).

**Features**:

- Proxy and managed Relays now apply clock drift correction based on the `sent_at` header emitted by SDKs. ([#581](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/581))
- Apply cached rate limits to attachments and sessions in the fast-path when parsing incoming requests. ([#618](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/618))
- New config options `metrics.default_tags` and `metrics.hostname_tag`. ([#625](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/625))

**Bug Fixes**:

- Clock drift correction no longer considers the transaction timestamp as baseline for SDKs using Envelopes. Instead, only the dedicated `sent_at` Envelope header is used. ([#580](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/580))
- The `http.timeout` setting is now applied to all requests, including event submission. Previously, events were exempt. ([#588](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/588))
- All endpoint metrics now report their proper `route` tag. This applies to `requests`, `requests.duration`, and `responses.status_codes`. Previously, some some endpoints reported an empty route. ([#595](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/595))
- Properly refresh cached project states based on the configured intervals. Previously, Relay may have gone into an endless refresh cycle if the system clock not accurate, or the state had not been updated in the upstream. ([#596](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/596))
- Respond with `403 Forbidden` when multiple authentication payloads are sent by the SDK. Previously, Relay would authenticate using one of the payloads and silently ignore the rest. ([#602](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/602))
- Improve metrics documentation. ([#614](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/614))
- Do not scrub event processing errors by default. ([#619](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/619))

**Internal**:

- Add source (who emitted the outcome) to Outcome payload. ([#604](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/604))
- Ignore non-Rust folders for faster rebuilding and testing. ([#578](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/578))
- Invalid session payloads are now logged for SDK debugging. ([#584](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/584), [#591](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/591))
- Add support for Outcomes generation in external Relays. ([#592](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/592))
- Remove unused `rev` from project state. ([#586](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/586))
- Add an outcome endpoint for trusted Relays. ([#589](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/589))
- Emit outcomes for event payloads submitted in attachment files. ([#609](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/609))
- Split envelopes that contain sessions and other items and ingest them independently. ([#610](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/610))
- Removed support for legacy per-key quotas. ([#616](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/615))
- Security events (CSP, Expect-CT, Expect-Staple, and HPKP) are now placed into a dedicated `security` item in envelopes, rather than the generic event item. This allows for quick detection of the event type for rate limiting. ([#617](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/617))

## 0.5.9

- Add way to scrub filepaths in a way that does not break processing.

## 0.5.2

- Fix trivial Redis-related crash when running in non-processing mode.
- Limit the maximum retry-after of a rate limit. This is necessary because of the "Delete and ignore future events" feature in Sentry.
- Project caches are now evicted after `project_grace_period` has passed. If you have that parameter set to a high number you may see increased memory consumption.

**Internal**:

- Misc bugfixes in PII processor. Those bugs do not affect the legacy data scrubber exposed in Python.

## 0.4.0

Introducing new Relay modes:

- `proxy`: A proxy for all requests and events.
- `static`: Static configuration for known projects in the file system.
- `managed`: Fetch configurations dynamically from Sentry and update them.

The default Relay mode is `managed`. Users upgrading from previous versions will automatically activate the `managed` mode. To change this setting, add `relay.mode` to `config.yml` or run `semaphore config init` from the command line.

**Breaking Change**: If Relay was used without credentials, the mode needs to be set to `proxy`. The default `managed` mode requires credentials.

For more information on Relay modes, see the [documentation page](https://docs.sentry.io/data-management/relay/options/).

### Configuration Changes

- Added `cache.event_buffer_size` to control the maximum number of events that are buffered in case of network issues or high rates of incoming events.
- Added `limits.max_concurrent_requests` to limit the number of connections that this Relay will use to communicate with the upstream.
- Internal error reporting is now disabled by default. To opt in, set `sentry.enabled`.

### Bugfixes

- Fix a bug that caused events to get unconditionally dropped after five seconds, regardless of the `cache.event_expiry` configuration.
- Fix a memory leak in Relay's internal error reporting.

## 0.3.0

- Changed PII stripping rule format to permit path selectors when applying rules. This means that now `$string` refers to strings for instance and `user.id` refers to the `id` field in the `user` attribute of the event. Temporarily support for old rules is retained.

## 0.2.7

- store: Minor fixes to be closer to Python. Ability to disable trimming of objects, arrays and strings.

## 0.2.6

- Fix bug where PII stripping would remove containers without leaving any metadata about the retraction.
- Fix bug where old `redactPair` rules would stop working.

## 0.2.5

- Rewrite of PII stripping logic. This brings potentially breaking changes to the semantics of PII configs. Most importantly field types such as `"freeform"` and `"databag"` are gone, right now there is only `"container"` and `"text"`. All old field types should have become an alias for `"text"`, but take extra care in ensuring your PII rules still work.

- store: Minor fixes to be closer to Python.

## 0.2.4

For users of relay, nothing changed at all. This is a release to test embedding some Rust code in Sentry itself.

- store: Remove stray print statement.

## 0.2.3

For users of relay, nothing changed at all. This is a release to test embedding some Rust code in Sentry itself.

- store: Fix main performance issues.

## 0.2.2

For users of relay, nothing changed at all. This is a release to test embedding some Rust code in Sentry itself.

- store: Fix segfault when trying to process contexts.
- store: Fix trimming state "leaking" between interfaces, leading to excessive trimming.
- store: Don't serialize empty arrays and objects (with a few exceptions).

## 0.2.1

For users of relay, nothing changed at all. This is a release to test embedding some Rust code in Sentry itself.

- `libsemaphore`: Expose CABI for normalizing event data.

## 0.2.0

Our first major iteration on Relay has landed!

- User documentation is now hosted at <https://docs.sentry.io/relay/>.
- SSL support is now included by default. Just configure a [TLS identity](https://docs.sentry.io/relay/options/#relaytls_identity_path) and you're set.
- Updated event processing: Events from older SDKs are now supported. Also, we've fixed some bugs along the line.
- Introduced full support for PII stripping. See [PII Configuration](https://docs.sentry.io/relay/pii-config/) for instructions.
- Configure with static project settings. Relay will skip querying project states from Sentry and use your provided values instead. See [Project Configuration](https://docs.sentry.io/relay/project-config/) for a full guide.
- Relay now also acts as a proxy for certain API requests. This allows it to receive CSP reports and Minidump crash reports, among others. It also sets `X-Forwarded-For` and includes a Relay signature header.

Besides that, there are many technical changes, including:

- Major rewrite of the internals. Relay no longer requires a special endpoint for sending events to upstream Sentry and processes events individually with less delay than before.
- The executable will exit with a non-zero exit code on startup errors. This makes it easier to catch configuration errors.
- Removed `libsodium` as a production dependency, greatly simplifying requirements for the runtime environment.
- Greatly improved logging and metrics. Be careful with the `DEBUG` and `TRACE` levels, as they are **very** verbose now.
- Improved docker containers.

## 0.1.3

- Added support for metadata format

## 0.1.2

- JSON logging ([#32](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/pull/32))
