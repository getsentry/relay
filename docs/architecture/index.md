# Architecture

This subsection contains internal docs that are useful for development and
operation of Relay.

> **Important Note**: Relay is undergoing extensive internal restructuring. This
> includes:
>
>  - The introduction of _Envelopes_ for event ingestion.
>  - Updated rate limits to handle items different from each other.
>  - Changes to the project configuration and fetching mechanism.
>  - Optimizations in the rate limiting fast path.
>
> Once these changes are completed, this document will be updated with new
> descriptions about event ingestion and the architecture.
