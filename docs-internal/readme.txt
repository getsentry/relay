This directory contains documents relevant to the developers of semaphore.

Note: Some files (like actors.md) contain graphviz style code blocks.
In order to see the code blocks as diagrams you would need to use a markdown editor that supports graphviz
style code blocks.

Typora (https://www.typora.io) text editor is able to render the code blocks as graphs.
