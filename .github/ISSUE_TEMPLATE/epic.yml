        ## Infrastructure checklist

        Be sure to assess the infrastructure impact of your initiative early on, such that
        the required work can be planned in advance.

        - [ ] Will this affect CPU and / or memory usage?
        - [ ] Does this plan require different machine types (different memory to CPU ratio)?
        - [ ] Does this plan require new autoscaling rules? Will it impact the metric that the autoscaler uses?
        - [ ] Will this increase the load on redis, kafka, or the HTTP upstream?
        - [ ] Does this plan require larger disks or different disk types?
        - [ ] Will it affect health checks and/or HTTP response times?

        ## Implementation

        Once the planning is done, list implementation tasks here.
