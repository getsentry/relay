notes = "I own this crate, and most of its versions were codeveloped and reviewed by Nika Layzell. This version was not explicitly reviewed by her, but it was specifically a release that made the code pass miri and was reviewed by me. Firefox uses it in the gecko-ffi configuration which is less thoroughly tested and more dangerous but we're reasonably confident in it. The real danger is from C++ code failing to use it correctly in FFI but that's just how FFI is."
