//! Metric protocol, aggregation and processing for Sentry.
//!
//! Metrics are high-volume values sent from Sentry clients, integrations, or extracted from errors
//! and transactions, that can be aggregated and queried over large time windows. As opposed to rich
//! errors and transactions, metrics carry relatively little context information in tags with low
//! cardinality.
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! Clients submit metrics in a [text-based protocol](Metric) based on StatsD. A sample submission
//! looks like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! endpoint.response_time@millisecond:57|d|#route:user_index
//! endpoint.hits:1|c|#route:user_index
//! ```
//!
//! The metric type is part of its signature just like the unit. Therefore, it is allowed to reuse a
//! metric name for multiple metric types, which will result in multiple metrics being recorded.
//!
//! # Metric Envelopes
//!
//! To send one or more metrics to Relay, the raw protocol is enclosed in an envelope item of type
//! `metrics`:
//!
//! ```text
//! {}
//! {"type": "metrics", "timestamp": 1615889440, ...}
//! endpoint.response_time@millisecond:57|d|#route:user_index
//! ...
//! ```
//!
//! Note that the name format used in the statsd protocol is different from the MRI: Metric names
//! are not prefixed with `<ty>:` as the type is somewhere else in the protocol.
//!
//! The timestamp in the item header is used to send backdated metrics. If it is omitted,
//! the `received` time of the envelope is assumed.
//!
//! # Aggregation
//!
//! Relay accumulates all metrics in [time buckets](Bucket) before sending them onwards. Aggregation
//! is handled by the [`Aggregator`], which should be created once for the entire system. It flushes
//! aggregates in regular intervals, either shortly after their original time window has passed or
//! with a debounce delay for backdated submissions.
//!
//! **Warning**: With chained Relays submission delays accumulate.
//!
//! Aggregate buckets are encoded in JSON with the following schema:
//!
//! ```json
//! [
//!   {
//!     "name": "endpoint.response_time",
//!     "unit": "millisecond",
//!     "value": [36, 49, 57, 68],
//!     "type": "d",
//!     "timestamp": 1615889440,
//!     "width": 10,
//!     "tags": {
//!       "route": "user_index"
//!     }
//!   },
//!   {
//!     "name": "endpoint.hits",
//!     "value": 4,
//!     "type": "c",
//!     "timestamp": 1615889440,
//!     "width": 10,
//!     "tags": {
//!       "route": "user_index"
//!     }
//!   }
//! ]
//! ```
//!
//! # Ingestion
//!
//! Processing Relays write aggregate buckets into the ingestion Kafka stream. The schema is similar
//! to the aggregation payload, with the addition of scoping information. Each bucket is sent in a
//! separate message:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "org_id": 1,
//!   "project_id": 42,
//!   "name": "endpoint.response_time",
//!   "unit": "millisecond",
//!   "value": [36, 49, 57, 68],
//!   "type": "d",
//!   "timestamp": 1615889440,
//!   "tags": {
//!     "route": "user_index"
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
