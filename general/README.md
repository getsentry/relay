# General - Sentry Annotated Protocol

General is a support library for [semaphore](https://github.com/getsentry/semaphore).  It implements the
annotated Sentry protocol that supports metadata to be sent alongside.  It also implements a general
processing layer.  This is a replacement for the older marshal library.
